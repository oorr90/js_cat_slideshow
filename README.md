# JavaScript Cat Slideshow
This project was an assignment for Scripting for the Web @ SMCC Fall 2017

### Project Instructions

Phase 1:
clicking the image of the seer below causes a cat to appear in the slideshow.
clicking the cat switches its image to the next cat.
if the last picture of the cat is clicked, it goes to the first cat image.

Phase 2:
clicking the image of the seer below causes a cat to appear in the slideshow.
mousing over the cat to the right switches the cat picture every 10 pixels.
mousing out of the cat resets the default X location so you can mouse over the cat again.

Phase 3:
same as Phase 2, but mousing to the left goes backwards through the cat images and mousing to the right goes forward through the cat images.
